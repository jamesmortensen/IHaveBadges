IHaveBadges
===========

This is just a very simple Userscript that makes your badges in the Stack Exchange top header bar clickable so that it
takes you directly to the badges section of your profile.

To install it, see the instructions on [Stack Apps](http://stackapps.com/q/3759/4812).  Alternatively, if you're no stranger to installing Userscripts, here's the [direct link](https://github.com/jamesmortensen/IHaveBadges/raw/master/ihavebadges.user.js).
